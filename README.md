# deal-app

## Project setup
Dependencies are included, since this project is just a zip of my local project folder. Just in case, you may need to run `npm install`.


## Running the app
First, start the express server with `npm run express`. Then, in another tab, you can start the Vue dev server with `npm run serve`.

## Running the tests
First, make sure the express server is currently running. Run the unit tests with `npm run test:unit` and run the End-to-end tests with `npm run test:e2e`.
